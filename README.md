This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

## Razorpay payment setup

The registration flow uses Razorpay Standard Checkout only; it does not accept bank-transfer details or payment-proof uploads.

Set these server-only environment variables in the deployment environment (and in `.env.local` for development):

```bash
RAZORPAY_KEY_ID=rzp_test_...
RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET=...
RAZORPAY_WEBHOOK_SECRET=use-a-separate-long-random-secret
```

In Razorpay Dashboard, enable automatic capture and add this webhook endpoint for both Test and Live mode:

```text
https://YOUR-DOMAIN/api/payments/razorpay/webhook
```

Subscribe to `payment.captured`, `payment.authorized`, `payment.failed`, and `payment.refunded`. Test the complete flow with test keys before replacing them with Live keys. The key secret and webhook secret must never be exposed to the browser or committed to source control.

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
